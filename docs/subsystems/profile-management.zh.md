# Profile 管理

[English](profile-management.md) | 中文

Profile 管理 API 列出运行中 profile 的 Plugin 和 bundle、修改持久化组合，并管理 bundle 安装。[dsh-plugin-manager](../../packages/boot/plugin-manager/README.zh.md) 定义操作结果、取消行为和重启要求；[dsh-app-boot](../../packages/boot/app-boot/README.zh.md) 定义启动器提供的 `profileContext` 信息。

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.zh.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.pluginManagementHost` — `PluginManagementHost`

Launcher-owned configuration support; package transactions remain with the launcher.

```ts cordis-catalog
/** Read the complete application patch stack, including mandatory overlays.
 * @returns Detached patches ready for Loader reconciliation, without changing resolver links.
 */
readPatches(): PatchOptions[]
```

### `ctx.pluginManager` — `PluginManager`

Manage profile files and apply their declared reload lifecycle.

```ts cordis-catalog
/** Read current plugins, including why a row cannot be changed through the profile patch.
 * @returns Current runtime entries with persistent patch targets.
 */
@Remote async listPlugins(): Promise<PluginInfo[]>

/** Read the profile's installed bundles, the bundles this dsh installation supplies, and the selected names that are not bundles.
 * A dependency without a bundle patch is listed, as a `not-bundle` problem, only while it is selected.
 * @returns Package versions, one-liners, rows, activation selections, whether the installation offers the
 * bundle, and removal availability.
 */
@Remote listBundles(): Promise<BundleInfo[]>

/** Read what a spec names before installing it.
 * @param spec One package spec: a registry name, an absolute path, a git address, or a tarball.
 * @param signal Ends a registry lookup early.
 * @returns The package the spec names, or why it is refused.
 */
@Remote async inspect(spec: string, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<PluginSpecInspection>

/** Persist a plugin entry's desired enablement and apply it on live profiles.
 * @param id Loader entry identity returned by listPlugins.
 * @param enabled Whether the plugin should run.
 * @returns Saved and runtime outcomes, including higher-priority overrides.
 */
@Remote setPluginEnabled(id: PluginEntryId, enabled: boolean): Promise<ChangeResult>

/** Select or remove a bundle layer while retaining installed dependencies.
 * @param name Bundle package name.
 * @param enabled Whether the bundle contributes its patch layer.
 * @returns Persisted and runtime outcomes.
 */
@Remote setBundleEnabled(name: string, enabled: boolean): Promise<ChangeResult>

/**
 * Install a package using the same pnpm implementation as dsh plugin. A run
 * that fails, is cancelled, or adds a package without a bundle patch restores
 * `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` as they were; downloaded files can stay.
 * @param spec One package spec, including local paths relative to the invocation directory.
 * @param options Whether to activate the installed bundle (defaults to true), the request id a cancellation names, and
 * the pending build scripts to allow for this profile before pnpm runs.
 * @returns Package-manager diagnostics and observed activation outcome.
 */
@Remote installBundle(spec: string, options?: InstallBundleOptions): Promise<ChangeResult>

/** Stop an installation this manager owns and wait until its files are back.
 * @param requestId The id the installation was started with.
 * @returns `cancelled` once pnpm exited and the files are restored, `too-late` once the bundle is being
 * applied, `not-running` for any other id.
 */
@Remote async cancelInstall(requestId: PluginInstallRequestId): Promise<PluginInstallCancellation>

/** Unload and remove a profile-owned bundle dependency through dsh plugin's pnpm path.
 * @param name Installed dependency name.
 * @returns Removal diagnostics and the remaining profile state.
 */
@Remote removeBundle(name: string): Promise<ChangeResult>

### `ctx.profileContext` — `ProfileContext`

Current profile facts; scheduling and mutation belong to their callers.

### `plugin-manager/*` events

<a id="plugin-managerchanged--emit"></a>

#### `plugin-manager/changed` — emit

The profile's plugins, bundles, or composition changed: a manager operation completed. A patch generation applied outside the manager, by HMR's watcher after a CLI or hand edit, announces nothing here.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * The profile's plugins, bundles, or composition changed: a manager
 * operation completed. A patch generation applied outside the manager,
 * by HMR's watcher after a CLI or hand edit, announces nothing here.
 * @mode emit
 * @param change - what changed.

'plugin-manager/changed'(change: PluginChange): void
```

<a id="plugin-managerinstall-log--emit"></a>

#### `plugin-manager/install-log` — emit

One chunk of a pnpm run's output, streamed as the run produces it.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * One chunk of a pnpm run's output, streamed as the run produces it.
 * @mode emit
 * @param chunk - the chunk and the run it belongs to.

<a id="plugin-managerinstall-state--emit"></a>

#### `plugin-manager/install-state` — emit

An installation moved between its Host phases.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * An installation moved between its Host phases.
 * @mode emit
 * @param progress - the installation's request id and phase.
 */
'plugin-manager/install-state'(progress: PluginInstallProgress): void
