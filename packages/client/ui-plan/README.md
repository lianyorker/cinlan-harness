English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

Turn plan mode off from the composer, review a submitted plan in the sidebar, and reopen logged plans from completed turns. The status chip follows the Host projection; plan cards derive from logged `exit_plan_mode` invocations. Preview consumers attach to an available sidebar without changing its public API. `dsh-plan-mode` owns the command, committed state, policy, and review decision.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin alongside `ui-conversation` and `dsh-plan-mode`; the chip then occupies the composer's plan seat to the right of the access-mode control whenever plan mode is active. Enter plan mode through the `/plan` command path — choose Plan from the composer's `+` Command menu or type `/plan` — and turn it off with the chip.

### What the chip shows

While the effective target is plan mode, the seat renders the warn-colored "Plan ×" status button, which executes `/plan off`. Otherwise the seat stays empty: a host without plan mode, or a Draft with no session, shows nothing. While plan mode is the effective target, the composer textarea's placeholder switches to the plan-task hint — "describe your task to generate plan" — unless the owning surface supplies its own placeholder.

### Submitted plans and review

With a preview-capable sidebar, a pending review opens its full plan once and keeps a manual opener beside the approval controls. Opening a preview never answers the review. Completed turns retain one card per logged `exit_plan_mode` invocation, in invocation order; reopening a card resolves the exact Session and call, including delegated Sessions and paged history. A review without a logged call uses a temporary document.

### Failures

Admission failures (`matched: false`, business errors, transport faults) surface as an inline error and the chip stays until the projection confirms the exit.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The chip occupies the conversation-declared `conversation.input.plan` single seat; the node half is an empty apply (the roster row). Reads ride the generic projection pair through the standard-kit `useProjection`: the effective target is `pending ? !active : active` — a folded host value, not client optimism, so an arriving frame corrects the chip either way. The seat's injected face carries one verb, `exitPlanMode`, which executes `/plan off` through `ctx.remote.commands.execute` and maps admission failures to an inline error line. The placeholder and hint text live in ui-conversation's `conversation` locale namespace and are shared verbatim with the claimed `/plan` command hint. The accessible description is "Plan mode on, press to turn off".

The conversation projection records submitted plans from tool invocations. Optional consumers use the existing `sidebarRight` or `betterSidebar` services; when both exist, the local better-sidebar opener takes precedence. Cards register in `conversation.chat.turnCards`, independently of the existing `conversation.chat.turnTail` chain. The `conversation.plan-review.actions` list contributes preview navigation without owning approval.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the plan surface is not enough. They move from the chip to the plan-mode domain and the composer shell.

- [dsh-plan-mode](../../plan/plan-mode/README.md) — owns plan mode, the `/plan` command, the projection, and the policy section.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares the composer's `conversation.input.plan` seat and the placeholder locale keys.
- [Tool catalog](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-plan-mode) — the `exit_plan_mode` tool schema the model uses to leave plan mode.
- [Client package map](../README.md) — adjacent browser UI packages.

## Model Experience

Indirectly, through the `/plan off` command line the chip dispatches: `dsh-plan-mode` owns the model-visible policy section, the exit-tool schema, and the logged state that line drives.

#### KV Cache effect

Entering or leaving plan mode changes the active `plan:policy` system-prompt section and therefore the request prefix; the chip itself adds no prompt content.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


The plan controls and previews have these limits:

- **Plan mode is guidance, not an execution sandbox** — deployments that require enforced read-only planning must compose the independent sandbox and approval policies.
- **The chip belongs to the default composer** — a pending whole-composer interaction such as plan review temporarily replaces the InputBar and its chip.
- **No inactive plan control** — entry uses the shared Command source; a session with the capability but inactive mode shows no plan affordance in the tool row.
- **Preview dependencies are optional** — without a supported sidebar and Session history services, the chip remains available but preview cards and openers do not register. Temporary review documents do not survive a page reload.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. Plan state and boundary ownership are audited by dsh-plan-mode, while the control is a slot effect whose declaration, registration, and teardown are exercised by this package.
